### Notes
- **Grandma's Secrets:** At the home of a Swedish friend, Grandma tasted a pastry flavored with a little cardamom. She tried a little cardamom in the filling of these biscuits and found it gave the biscuits a flavor that was perfect with coffee. She started with ¼ teaspoon ground cardamom, and when she found she liked the flavor, she added a little bit more the next time.

| **Tags** | pasta, Italian, manicotti, ricotta, cheese, baked |
| **Source** | Recipe card — Grandma's Kitchen: Treasured Family Recipes™ |
| **Image** | IMG_1532.jpg |

### Ingredients
- 12 large manicotti shells
- 4 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided
- 2 cups ricotta cheese
- 6 tablespoons chopped fresh basil or 2 tablespoons dried basil
- 1 (26-ounce) jar prepared spaghetti sauce, divided
- ½ cup grated Parmesan or Romano cheese

### Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Spray 13 x 9-inch baking dish with nonstick cooking spray.
2. Cook pasta according to package directions. Drain; rinse with cool water. Let pasta dry on paper towels.
3. For filling, in medium bowl, stir together 3 cups mozzarella with the ricotta and fresh basil.
4. Using a teaspoon, carefully stuff pasta shells with prepared cheese mixture.
5. Spoon 2 cups spaghetti sauce into prepared baking dish. Arrange stuffed pasta over sauce.
6. Pour remaining spaghetti sauce over top of pasta. Sprinkle with remaining mozzarella.
7. Bake manicotti for 15 minutes. Sprinkle with the Parmesan; bake for 10 minutes longer.
8. Serve immediately.

### Notes
- **Grandma's Secrets:** Another method Grandma used to stuff the cooked manicotti was to "pipe" the filling into the pasta. First, Grandma would put the cheese mixture in a large, heavy-duty resealable plastic food storage bag. She would seal the bag and then cut off one corner, making the cut about the same size as the manicotti opening. Then she would gently squeeze the bag to fill the pasta with the cheese mixture.

### Ingredients
- 1½ tablespoons butter
- 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1½ cups milk
- 3 to 4 teaspoons dry ranch-style salad dressing mix
- ¼ to ½ teaspoon white pepper
- 1 cup chopped onion
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1½ cups sliced fresh mushrooms
- 1¼ pounds fresh green beans, cooked until crisp-tender
- 1 cup fresh bread crumbs, toasted

### Instructions
1. To make white sauce, melt butter in small saucepan over low heat. Stir in flour; cook 1 to 2 minutes, stirring constantly.
2. Using wire whisk, stir in milk; bring to a boil.
3. Cook, whisking constantly, 1 to 2 minutes or until thickened.
4. Stir in dressing mix and white pepper; set aside.
5. Preheat oven to 350°F. Spray medium skillet with nonstick cooking spray; heat over medium-high heat.
6. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir 2 to 3 minutes or until tender. Remove half of onion mixture; set aside.
7. Add mushrooms to remaining onion mixture in skillet and cook about 5 minutes or until mushrooms are tender.
8. Combine mushroom mixture, green beans and white sauce in 1½-quart casserole.

### Notes
- **Grandma's Secrets:** When Grandma needed bread crumbs, she made them by hand grating day-old bread. Instead of using a sharp grater, try this easy method: Remove crusts from day-old bread. Tear slices into pieces. Put pieces in a food processor or blender and process them using an on/off pulsing action until you have fine crumbs.

| **Tags** | potato, soup, ham, cheese, comfort food, winter |
| **Source** | Recipe card — Grandma's Kitchen: Treasured Family Recipes™ |
| **Image** | IMG_1540.jpg |

### Ingredients
- 3 medium red potatoes
- 2 cups water
- 1 small onion
- 3 tablespoons butter
- 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- Crushed red pepper flakes
- Ground black pepper
- 3 cups milk
- ½ teaspoon sugar
- 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
- 1 cup cubed cooked ham

### Instructions
1. Peel potatoes and cut into 1-inch cubes.
2. Bring water to a boil in large saucepan. Add potatoes and cook until tender. Drain, reserving liquid. Set aside potatoes.
3. Measure 1 cup cooking liquid, adding water, if necessary; set aside.
4. Peel and finely chop onion. Melt butter in saucepan over medium heat. Add onion to saucepan; cook, stirring frequently, until onion is translucent and tender, but not brown.
5. Add flour to saucepan; season with pepper flakes and black pepper to taste. Cook 3 to 4 minutes.

### Notes
- **Grandma's Secrets:** To make this a filling meal, Grandma usually served this soup with fresh bread. For a slightly different twist, serve it in individual bread bowls. To make them, buy small round loaves of a hearty bread, such as Italian, and slice off a small piece from the top. Then remove the inside of the loaf, leaving a 1½-inch shell; fill with hot soup.

## Sausage Swirls

|---|---|
| **Category** | Appetizer |
| **Tags** | sausage, crescent rolls, party food, make-ahead |
| **Source** | Typed recipe sheet |
| **Image** | IMG_1542.jpg |
| **Yield** | 32 slices total |

### Ingredients
- Two 8oz cans of crescent dinner rolls
- 1 pound of ground sausage (any flavor, I prefer sage), cut into eight chunks

### Instructions
1. Separate one can of dough and form four rectangles (rather than eight triangles). Press the seam together to seal. Using your fingers, spread thinly and completely (you will be rolling these up). Starting at the short end, roll each rectangle into a tight cylinder. Repeat this process with the other can of dough and remaining sausage. Place the rolls on a plate (I prefer to use two plates and put four on a plate), cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes to one hour. Once each roll has firmed up, cut each roll into four even slices. (Will make 32 slices total)
2. Preheat oven to 375. Place slices on a flat pan or cookie sheet (I prefer to use parchment paper when I bake). Bake for 18-20 minutes or until dough is golden brown (sausage will cook as the dough cooks). Let cool for five minutes.

### Notes
- You can sprinkle some finely shredded cheese on the sausage before spreading it on the dough. Don't put too much or it will run off and burn during cooking. You may also sprinkle a little cheese on the swirls five minutes before they are done.

| **Image** | IMG_1545.jpg |
| **Yield** | Makes 12 biscuits |
| **Prep Time** | 15 minutes preparation, 12-15 minutes baking |

### Ingredients
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- 5 tablespoons chilled solid vegetable shortening
- 1 cup buttermilk

### Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 425°F. In a large bowl, sift together flour, baking powder, salt, and baking soda. Using a pastry blender or 2 knives, cut the shortening into the flour mixture until coarse crumbs form.
2. Add the buttermilk, tossing with a fork until a dough forms.
3. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Gather into a disk. Knead lightly a few times just until smooth. (The dough can be made up to 2 hours ahead, wrapped in plastic wrap, and refrigerated until ready to use.)
4. Pat the dough to ¾-inch thick. Using a biscuit cutter or a glass dipped in flour, cut out biscuits. Place the biscuits, 2 inches apart, on an ungreased baking sheet. Gather dough trimmings, pat to ¾-inch thick, and cut out more biscuits.
5. Bake the biscuits until golden, 12 to 15 minutes. Serve hot.

### Notes
- **Baking Tips:** To produce flaky biscuits, take care not to overhandle the dough. For less waste and a speedier preparation, pat the dough into a square, then cut into square-shape biscuits with a floured knife. Bake as directed above.
